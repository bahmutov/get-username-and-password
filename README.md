    npm install --save get-username-and-password

To use

```js
var getUsernameAndPassword = reqiure('get-username-and-password');
getUsernameAndPassword('just an example')
  .then(function (info) {
    console.log('you entered username "%s" and password "%s"',
      info.username, info.password);
  });
```

    just an example
    ? your username / email gleb
    ? your password ****
    you entered username "gleb" and password "ffff"

You can also provide either field via the environment variables, for example

    $ USERNAME=gleb node get-username-and-password.js 
    just an example
    ? your password ***
    you entered username "gleb" and password "fff"

Environment variables: USERNAME, PASSWORD

You can also provide username and / or password via options object

```js
var getUsernameAndPassword = reqiure('get-username-and-password');
getUsernameAndPassword({
  title: 'please enter the login info',
  username: 'john'
}).then(...);
// will ask for the password only
```

If there are questions, and the STDOUT is not a terminal, the promise will be rejected.
